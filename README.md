The DEF CON 22 Proplane Source Repository

This repository is the exact source used for the demo.  Continued progress will be made on it in the near future, but I have to get some boards fabricated for the snazzy new DEF CON 22 badges, since I gave both of the original prototypes to V3rt1g0 and 1057.

I'll have additional information up as soon as I can.  PCB Pool orders will go in as soon as I'm done with the work I need to do to keep the fgamily fed.  :-).


  Thank you,
  Phorkus.
